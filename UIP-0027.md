# UIP-27: Transaction service fields

## Abstract

  This document describes protocol changes in the transaction structure:
the `nVersion` field is going to be replaced by four separate service fields:
* type
* version
* two more fields are vacant


## Motivation

  [UIP-0018](https://github.com/dtr-org/uips/blob/master/UIP-0018.md) introduced **a transaction type** concept 
and added the corresponding field as a part of already existing `nVersion` field. 
That was achieved by overloading `nVersion` with bit arithmetic at the cost of increasing complexity of the code.

  By implementing separate service fields we solve the following problems:
  
  1. Clean-up the logic behind the `type` and `version` fields.
  2. Minimize the size of `type` and `version` fields.
  3. Minimize the impact on the existing test suite.
  
  As an additional benefit, we will have two more fields for possible future needs.
  
  
## Specification

At the moment we have this `nVersion` field structure:
 
_These pictures illustrate `nVersion` in big-endian order as we have it in the runtime. 
It's worth noting, however, that the serialized bytes will have a little-endian order._

```
  0x00      0x00     0x00      0x00   
^------^  ^------^  ^----------------^
 unused     type         version      
^------------------------------------^
             nVersion
```

* `nVersion` - original `uint32_t` value
* `type` - derived `uint8_t` attribute
* `version` - derived `uint16_t` attribute

Proposed layout for the same bytes:
```
  0x00      0x00      0x00      0x00     
^------^  ^------^  ^------^  ^------^   
reserved    type    reserved  version    
```

* `type` - independent`uint8_t` field
* `version` - independent`uint8_t` field


## Rationale

This format was chosen in order to preserve the existing byte order and to minimize the impact on the existing test suite.
It's very hard to add, remove or even swap existing bytes due to a couple of reasons:

* Tests contain a lot of magic numbers, based on the assumptions regarding transaction size.
* Some tests heavily rely on hardcoded, unique transactions from the real Bitcoin network.
* Unit-e wants to sync regularly with Bitcoin Core with minimal effort.

All these conditions make structural changes hard, thus it's much more effective
to act in the context of the existing layout.

By implementing four separate fields we decouple unrelated entities, remove technical debt
without a tremendous amount of extra work and keep our test suite intact hence eliminate some range of security risks.


## Backwards compatibility

The proposed change will have a minimal impact on existing Unit-e codebase and will not change the byte order of existing messages.
We shrink the actual size of `version` field down to 1 byte, but it's not a problem, because the range
of [0, 255] integer values is more than enough to reflect existing transaction versions.

## Reference implementation

Work in progress.
